Utility to help you train english vocabulary.

## How it works
It's a common knowledge that the best way to learn foreign words is to memorize them together with surrounding context.

Let's suppose you want to watch TV series, but also want to learn english. This app suggests you the following pipeline:
- You watch series with english subtitles and see unfamiliar word
- Stop the video, type in a terminal `./main.py append`
- Enter the definition and sentence from subtitles, but replacing the word with underscores. 

Here is a demonstration:

## How to launch
To make script executable, run `chmod +x main.py`. Then you can run `./main.py`.

The only requirement is Python 3.7+
